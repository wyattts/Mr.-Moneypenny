# Changelog

All notable changes to Mr. Moneypenny are documented here. The format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Default Anthropic model is now `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (was `claude-sonnet-4-6`). Cuts API cost ~4–5× for typical workloads. Existing v0.1.0 installs auto-pick-up Haiku on next launch unless they've explicitly set `anthropic_model`. Users who prefer Sonnet's heavier reasoning can override via the `anthropic_model` setting key (Settings UI control planned for v0.2.0).

## [0.1.0] - early-alpha

First end-to-end working build. Smoke-tested on Fedora 43 (GNOME / Wayland).

### Added

- **Telegram bot** — long-polling against your own BotFather bot. The desktop app holds an open `getUpdates` connection; no relay, no inbound port. Multi-user pairing via 6-digit codes with 10-minute TTL. First chat to redeem becomes household owner; subsequent are members.
- **LLM tool-use** — Anthropic Claude (default model `claude-haiku-4-5`, ~4–5× cheaper than Sonnet at this workload; prompt caching enabled) or local Ollama. Seven tools: `add_expense`, `delete_expense`, `query_expenses`, `summarize_period`, `list_categories`, `set_budget`, `list_household_members`. The dispatcher strictly type-checks every input before any DB access; the LLM never sees or generates SQL.
- **Period pacing** — `compute_snapshot()` powers both the bot's "how am I doing this month" and the dashboard's KPI strip from the same math. Fixed expenses do not affect the variable-pacing flag, so paying rent on the 2nd never makes the user look "over."
- **Insights dashboard** — KPI strip (variable remaining / daily allowance / total spent / on-pace status), category donut (top 8 + Other), daily-trend line (variable solid + fixed dashed), per-household-member spend bars (only when ≥ 2 chats), top-5 expenses, over-budget table, upcoming-fixed table, month-over-month delta. Time-range picker (week / month / quarter / year / YTD). 5-second auto-refresh.
- **Ledger** view — filter by category, search description, paginated, inline delete.
- **Categories / Budgets / Household / Settings** views.
- **Setup wizard** — 8 steps, GUI-only on the Anthropic path (no terminal). Persists progress so you can resume after a crash.
- **System tray + close-to-tray + auto-start** — bot stays online when you close the window. Auto-start enabled by default on macOS / Windows; opt-in on Linux because GNOME tray support requires the AppIndicator extension.
- **Privacy posture** — outbound HTTPS allowlist enforced via Tauri CSP: only `api.telegram.org`, `api.anthropic.com`, and a user-configured Ollama endpoint. No analytics, no telemetry, no auto-uploaded crash reports. Secrets in OS keychain (Keychain / Credential Manager / libsecret).
- **AGPL-3.0** license, Contributor Covenant 2.1 CoC, contributing guide, security disclosure policy.
- **Linux release artifacts** — `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm`. macOS `.dmg` / Windows `.msi` produced unsigned by CI.

### Known limitations

- macOS and Windows artifacts are unsigned. Gatekeeper / SmartScreen warnings are bypassable; instructions in [`docs/distribution.md`](docs/distribution.md). Signing pending project sponsorship.
- AppImage requires `NO_STRIP=true` at build time on hosts with binutils ≥ 2.41 because the bundled `linuxdeploy` ships an older `strip`.
- GNOME tray icons require the [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/).
- Auto-update mechanism not yet wired up (binary is unsigned anyway). Plan: opt-in `tauri-plugin-updater` against GitHub Releases.
- Frontend bundle is ~633 KB (Recharts) — code-splitting deferred.
- Single host machine — the bot runs on whichever computer holds the database; multi-host sync is out of scope for v1.
- Only English UI strings.
- Branding placeholder; final logo and palette pending.
